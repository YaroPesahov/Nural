### About Nural
Nural Research was founded in 2020 with the mission of spreading understanding of data
science and its implications such that better decisions are made by several key stakeholders.
Those who make AI, those who use/implement AI, those who are affected by AI and those who
regulate AI.

The efforts are focused through the industries of healthcare and climate change with an
understanding that these are fundamental sectors that are ripe to be disrupted by AI if
properly implemented. The tone of content produced is targeted towards an audience with
technical prowess who will be utilising AI through their studies or work.
